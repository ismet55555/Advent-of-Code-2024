# Advent-of-Code-2024

Another year, another attempt at this fun thing!

Language: [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

## Running Code

- Run the code

  - ```sh
    cd day_x
    cargo run --release
    ```

- To actively monitor code issues use `bacon`:

  - Install [`bacon`](https://github.com/Canop/bacon): `cargo install --locked bacon`

  - ```sh
    bacon --all-features --job clippy
    ```
